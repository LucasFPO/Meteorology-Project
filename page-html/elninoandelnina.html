                    El Niño and La Niña are opposite phases of what is known as the El <br></br> 
                    Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. The ENSO cycle is a scientific <br></br>
                    term that describes the fluctuations in temperature between the ocean <br></br>  
                    and atmosphere in the east-central Equatorial Pacific.

            <div id="question" class="question2">
                <h2>How is it formed ?</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                    The term El Niño refers to the large-scale ocean-atmosphere climate <br></br> 
                    interaction linked to a periodic warming in sea surface temperatures <br></br> 
                    across the central and east-central Equatorial Pacific. La Niña episodes <br></br> 
                    represent periods of below-average sea surface temperatures across the <br></br> 
                    east-central Equatorial Pacific. Global climate La Niña impacts tend to <br></br> 
                    be opposite those of El Niño impacts. In the tropics, ocean temperature <br></br> 
                    variations in La Niña also tend to be opposite those of El Niño.

                </p>

                <h2>Consequences</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                    The presence of El Niño can significantly influence weather patterns, <br></br> 
                    ocean conditions, and marine fisheries across large portions of the globe <br></br> 
                    for an extended period of time. During a La Niña year, winter temperatures <br></br> 
                    are warmer than normal in the Southeast and cooler than normal in the Northwest.

                <p class="answer">
                    Blizzard is a big snowstorm. It is essential that the air
                    be very cold as it <br></br> has to be below freezing
                    for snow to fall and it is required a lot of moisture <br></br>
                    in the air for the snowflakes to form.
                </p>
    
            <div id="question" class="question2">
                <h2>How is it formed ?</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                    Blizzard starts in the same way as another storms. When 
                    two different massive <br></br> portions of air colide,
                    cold and warm air, the warmed is pushed up and the <br></br>
                    cold stays below the warm air. This makes a perfect condition
                    for wind <br></br> and water coming together. As the water goes
                    down, it gets freezed by the <br></br> cold air and snow emerge.
                    In order to be considered a blizzard, three things must happen: <br></br>
                    - Winds with at least 55km/h <br></br>
                    - Low visibility  <br></br>
                    - It has to last 3 or more hours long
                </p>
            </div>
    
            <div id="question" class="question3">
                <h2>Consequences</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                    This phenomenon can leave behing a massive quantity of snow accumulated. <br></br>
                    The main consequences are power outage, canceled flights and heavy traffic <br></br>
                    and congestion as it becomes impossible or hard enough to go anywhere. <br></br>
                    As a curiosity, Snowstorms are one type of winter storm. Icy winter storms <br></br>
                    bring freezing rain or sleet as well as snow. Blizzards are snowstorms with high winds.

                <h2>What is it ?</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                    A heatwave refers to a prolonged period of hot weather, which may be <br></br>
                    accompanied by high humidity. It is a unusual hot weather over a region <br></br>
                    persisting at least two consecutive days.

            <div id="question" class="question2">
                <h2>How is it formed ?</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                    Heat waves are generally the result of trapped air. High-pressure systems <br></br>
                    force air downward. This force prevents air near the ground from rising. <br></br>
                    The sinking air acts like a cap. It traps warm ground air in place. Without <br></br>
                    rising air, there are no rain, and nothing to prevent the hot air from get hotter.

                <h2>Consequences</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                    This phenomenon can be dangerous as is related to be cause of many deaths. <br></br>
                    Elderly and kids are more susceptible to heat wave impacts. It is important <br></br>
                    to keep yourself protected and hydrated. <br></br>
                    If the hot weather is too prolonged, plants will struggle to find enough water, <br></br>
                    go to seed and it will have a knock on effect on insects. Animals will struggle  <br></br>
                    as well, as they are desperate for water and it can cause effects on breeds and
                    reproduction.

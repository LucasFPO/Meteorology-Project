                <h2>What is it ?</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                    Considering that air pressure is the amount of force 
                    the molecules exert <br></br> on a given area; wind is caused 
                    by air flowing from an area of high pressure, <br></br> strong 
                    molecules cohesion, to an area of low pressure, weak molecules
                    cohesion.

            <div id="question" class="question2">
                <h2>How is it formed ?</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                    Air flows from high-pressure to low-pressure system  
                    to try to reach equilibrium <br></br> and by doing that,
                    wind is created. <br></br>                                         
                    Bigger the difference between high and low pressure, 
                    stronger is the wind. <br></br>                             
                    The Coriolis Effect that describes the flow of air masses
                    says that the <br></br> rotation of Earth deflects the direction of  
                    the winds to the right in <br></br> Northern Hemisphere and left in  
                    Southern Hemisphere.

                <h2>Consequences</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                    Wind can be sometimes just a breeze or strong enough 
                    to blow the roofs <br></br> off  buildings. This phenomenon can
                    be as well an effective erosion and <br></br> transportation
                    agent creating, for example, massive dunes. An incredible <br></br>
                    benefit from wind is the possibility to convert the air motion kinetic <br></br>
                    energy, wind power, in electricity. The so called Eolic Energy.

                <h2>What is it ?</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                    Drought is a prolonged period of high temperatures
                    and lack of precipitation. <br></br> A drought can be related
                    to an overuse of water supply and overpopulation <br></br> as well.
                    When too much people use and demand water and less than <br></br>
                    average rainfall occurs to regenerate.

            <div id="question" class="question2">
                <h2>How is it formed ?</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                    This phenomenon occurs when persistent high pressure in the
                    atmosphere <br></br>  curbs cloud formation due to lower evaporation. That
                    leads to lower relative <br></br>  humidity in atmosphere and hence, less precipitation.
                    The high pressure system, when bigger, <br></br>  is capable to persist for months or more,
                    blocking storms carrying rain and snow.

                <h2>Consequences</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                    The devastation of a drought can be enormous as it destroy the crop
                    making <br></br> less food available, it dries out the water from reservoirs
                    reducing the <br></br> amount of potable water available and It can be dangerous 
                    to human health <br></br> as well because the air quality becomes low and particles
                    from wildfires <br></br> and dry soils can irritate the airways and worsen chronic 
                    respiratory illnesses <br></br> and increase respiratory infections.

                    Flood are a portion of area covered by water due to heavy rainfall. <br></br>
                    The water can spread quickly, inundating everything ahead. Usually the <br></br>
                    problem emerge when rivers and sewers no long are able to hold so much <br></br>
                    water and it starts to overflow.

            <div id="question" class="question2">
                <h2>How is it formed ?</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                    Warmer temperatures and increase moisture in the atmosphere
                    are related <br></br> to heavy rainfall. Warm air can hold more moisture
                    than cool air, so when <br></br> the warmer air is cooled and the moisture
                    condenses, it often rains more heavily.

                <h2>Consequences</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                   Heavy rainfall in a short period of time can cause innumerous damage <br></br>
                   as it inundate everything. Cars, house, buildings and electric power <br></br>
                   can suffer, causing hundreds of thousands of money in loss.    
                   When massive, <br></br> flood are capable to put an entire city underwater.
                   And even when no longer <br></br> is raining, the water can take a long time
                   to back out.

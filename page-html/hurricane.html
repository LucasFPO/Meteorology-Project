                    In order to form, a hurricane need a combination of
                    different things such as: <br></br>  
                    - warm ocean water, at least 27Â°C, in order to make evaporation
                    favorable, that later is gonna originate clouds. <br></br>  
                    - High leves of moisture in the atmosphere. <br></br>  
                    - Calm and steady wind, as it do not push away the clouds, making
                    favorable the emergence of storms.  <br></br>  
                    - The storm tends to get bigger and bigger as it is nourished by
                    the elements above. <br></br>                                         
                    - The storm begins to spin around itself and move. As long as it has
                    the necessary fuel, it keep growing and growing and with that
                    a hurricane is formed. <br></br>  
                    Hurricanes die down when they move over land or out of the tropics
                    and into cooler latitudes.

                <p class="answer">
                    A cold wave is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by a cooling <br></br> 
                    of the air. It is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24h period. <br></br> 
                    A cold wave can be also called as a cold snap.

            <div id="question" class="question2">
                <h2>How is it formed ?</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                    A cold wave is determined by the rate at wich the temperature falls and <br></br> 
                    the minimum to which it falls this minimum temperature is dependent on the <br></br> 
                    geographical region and time of the year

                <h2>Consequences</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                    This phenomenon demands protection to agriculture industry, commerce <br></br> 
                    and social activities as a cold wave can cause death and injure to crops, <br></br> 
                    livestock, wildlife and people. As the temperatures fall, the risk of  <br></br> 
                    hypothermia increases. Diseases like cold flu and pneumonia becomes  <br></br> 
                    commom when in a cold snap.
